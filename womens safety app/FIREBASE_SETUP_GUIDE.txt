                          1. WHAT IS FIREBASE?
================================================================================

Firebase is Google's platform that provides:

- AUTHENTICATION: Login system for your users
- DATABASE (Firestore): Storage for user data, guardians, SOS logs
- CLOUD MESSAGING: Push notifications to guardians
- FREE TIER: No credit card needed to start!

Think of it as the "backend server" that powers your Women Safety App.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Before starting, make sure you have:

[ ] Google Account (Gmail) - Create one at gmail.com if needed
[ ] Internet Connection - Stable connection required
[ ] Web Browser - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari
[ ] Project Folder - Your Women Safety App code on your computer
[ ] 15-20 minutes of uninterrupted time

================================================================================
                    3. STEP-BY-STEP FIREBASE SETUP

    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Guardians collection - authenticated users can manage guardians
    match /guardians/{guardianId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // SOS logs collection - authenticated users can create logs
    match /sos_logs/{logId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Location shares - anyone can read (so guardians can access)
    // Only authenticated users can create
    match /location_shares/{shareId} {
      allow read: if true;

================================================================================
                4. INSTALLING THE CONFIGURATION FILE
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 9: Move google-services.json to Project (5 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you'll do: Place the downloaded file in the correct folder

METHOD 1: Using File Explorer (Easier for Beginners)

2. Navigate to Downloads:
   - Click "Downloads" in the left sidebar
   - Find the file: google-services.json
   - Right-click on it → "Copy"

3. Navigate to Your Project:
   - Go to: C:\Users\leela\OneDrive\Desktop\women safety\safety-app\womens safety app
   - Double-click to open: android folder
   - Double-click to open: app folder
   - You should now be in: .../android/app/

4. Paste the File:
   - Right-click in empty space → "Paste"
   - The google-services.json file should now appear here

5. Verify Location:
   - Full path should be:
     C:\Users\leela\OneDrive\Desktop\women safety\safety-app\womens safety app\android\app\google-services.json


METHOD 2: Using PowerShell (Alternative)

1. Press Windows Key + X → Click "Windows PowerShell"

2. Copy and paste this command:
   cd "C:\Users\leela\OneDrive\Desktop\women safety\safety-app\womens safety app"

3. Press Enter

4. Copy and paste this command (adjust Desktop path if needed):
   Move-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\google-services.json" "android\app\google-services.json"

5. Press Enter

6. Verify with this command:
   Test-Path "android\app\google-services.json"

7. Should output: True (checkmark)

What you should see:
- The google-services.json file inside the android/app/ folder
- File size: 2-3 KB

Having trouble?
- Make sure the file is named exactly google-services.json 
  (no extra numbers or (1) in name)
- If you can't find the android folder, make sure you're in the 
  right project directory
- Don't put it in android/src/ or android/app/src/ 
  - it goes in android/app/

================================================================================
                        5. TESTING YOUR SETUP
================================================================================
